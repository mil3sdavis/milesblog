I had to made a a few edits to his process/script to make it work for what I wanted to do. He wrote a python script which was intended to transfer images from an #Obsidian vault, but it only accounted for PNG files, I modified the regex to account for JPEG/JPG and GIFs also.
Regex edit for image.py
# Step 2: Find all image links in the format ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%20...%20.png)#images = re.findall(r&#39;\[\[([^]]*\.png)\]\]&#39;, content)images = re.findall(r&#39;\[\[([^]]*\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif))\]\]&#39;, content, re.IGNORECASE) NetworkChuck also didn&rsquo;t explain the process for setting up auto deploy on Hostinger which requires setting up a webhook from Hostinger that is triggered when a post is uploaded to GitHub.
