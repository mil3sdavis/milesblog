      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cisco-asa-5510&#34;&gt;Cisco ASA 5510&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to brush up on my networking skills, so I thought that I would dig out the old hardware that I purchased back when I initially got my CCNA certification. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d first start with this ASA Firewall since many job listing I have been seeing for Network Engineer jobs have mentioned firewall configuration.  I purchased this ASA in probably 2017 or 2018 and it was way past end of life then (foreshadowing&amp;hellip;..).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I need to brush up on my networking skills, so I thought that I would dig out the old hardware that I purchased back when I initially got my CCNA certification. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d first start with this ASA Firewall since many job listing I have been seeing for Network Engineer jobs have mentioned firewall configuration.  I purchased this ASA in probably 2017 or 2018 and it was way past end of life then (foreshadowing&amp;hellip;..).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251205104321.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plugged the ASA into power and connected a Cisco console cable to it, i ran the other end of the console cable through an RS232 to USB adapter and opened up PuTTY. After adjusting the serial settings I was able to easily get to the login prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;logging-in&#34;&gt;Logging In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I hit my first snag, I had no idea what I set the username and password to 7 or 8 years ago&amp;hellip;. So I had to do a factory reset on the ASA which isn&amp;rsquo;t incredibly difficult but not something that is super intuitive. I had to interrupt the boot sequence and get into theROM Monitor (ROMmon) mode and change the configuration register for the boot sequence telling it to ignore current config on the device. From there I was able to reboot it with no loaded config, delete the stored config and then start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assumed that this would be the hardest part&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251205105607.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interface-setup&#34;&gt;Interface Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I set an IP address on one of the Ethernet ports and connected a laptop to that port. I setup the laptop on the same subnet and pinged the ASA successfully. I then enabled the http server on the ASA to enable access to the web GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251205105723.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disaster-strikes&#34;&gt;Disaster Strikes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to visit the web GUI in my browser, only to be greeted with an SSL/TLS mismatch error&amp;hellip;. uh oh.  A quick web search revealed that this version of the ASA firmware only supports TLS 1.0 and the only fix is a firmware upgrade. Well that seems easy&amp;hellip;. except Cisco doesn&amp;rsquo;t just give out firmware files, and even if I still had an account with them that had access to updates, it would appear that they no longer have the files available for this ASA because it is soo old (eol was in 2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to give up, but remembered that I had a laptop that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been booted up in almost as long as this ASA and though maybe it might work to access the web GUI. I set that laptop up, attempted to access the web GUI in Chrome and received the same error. Then I realized that this laptop still had Internet Explorer on it. I tried in IE, it allowed me to load the page after choosing to ignore the certificate errors&amp;hellip;.. At this point I thought my problems were solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI for the ASA (Cisco ASDM) is a JAVA program, so the webpage loaded on the ASA is really just a download page for the JAVA file. I downloaded the file, but when I went to run it, the PC let me know that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have JAVA installed&amp;hellip; ok fine, so I installed Java and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Java doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the ASDM file. So after another Google search I found many people with the same issue. The only solution appears to be to downgrade Java&amp;hellip;. but these posts were from  8 years ago&amp;hellip; and that version of Java is long gone&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ASA is now basically just a giant piece of e-waste. I did a little bit of searching to see if maybe it was possible to install some sort of alternate firmware on it like OpenWRT, but it would appear that most projects like that don&amp;rsquo;t support Cisco hardware because it is too specialized. So, I guess now I&amp;rsquo;m gonna need to find another firewall to play with&amp;hellip;. looked at some Palo Alto PA-820&amp;rsquo;s on eBay, they don&amp;rsquo;t go eol until 2029, so that&amp;rsquo;s probably a good choice&amp;hellip;. just gonna have to wait until after the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PCB Project part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;populated-board&#34;&gt;Populated Board&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I populated the board with the Arduino board and the pin headers. Assembly was very straight forward. I added pin headers for the GND and +12V lines for testing purposes, in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll either add a barrel connector or just wire the power supply directly to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251204102135.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-test&#34;&gt;The Test&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simhubdash.com/&#34;&gt;SimHub&lt;/a&gt; top program the Arduino via USB, connected the fans to the Right and Left fan channels and used a barrel connector that has screw terminals that was able to just slide over the GND/+12V pins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Here is the complete setup, fans on either side of the steering wheel are adjustable and can be pointed at the player. The fan setup performed flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251204102158.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to add friction fit connectors on the fan headers to ensure they don&amp;rsquo;t accidently disconnect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D Design/Print a case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power connector solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>PWM Wind Simulation PCB Design</title>
      <link>/posts/pwm-wind-simulation-pcb-design/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add Wind simulation to my Sim Racing setup. As you speed up/down you get more/less wind in your face, and you get directional wind in the corners. This helps with immersion by giving a sense of speed. The PC connects to the Arduino which provides the PWM control for the fans, and the fans are then powered by an external 12v power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software and hardware designs already exist for this, but they require that you build your own interface using an Arduino.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simhubdash.com/&#34;&gt;SimHub&lt;/a&gt; is the software that most people use to integrate Arduino microcontrollers with sim racing software titles. SimHub allows you to choose and configure the type of Arduino you would like to use and automatically generates the Arduino Sketch file to interface with the hardware setup. The following image shows the Arduino design for a 2 fan setup using an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/ATmega32U4-Micro-USB-Development-Compatible-ATmega328/dp/B07PHK8SMR&#34;&gt;Arduino ProMicro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented this design on some protoboard and got a working protype. The fans used are 12V PC case fans and require their own power supply. In this design, the +12V and GND pins of the fans are connected to an external 12V power supply and the sense pins on the fan are left unconnected, and the PWM pin is connected to the corresponding output on the Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251201110047.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prototype worked very well, but was not what I would consider pretty. So I took this as an opportunity to learn how to use some PCB design software. For this project I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://easyeda.com/&#34;&gt;EasyEDA&lt;/a&gt;to design the PCB and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcbway.com/&#34;&gt;PCBWay&lt;/a&gt;to manufacture the boards. The image below is the schematic design of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020251201113215.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the actual board layout with routing complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After routing was complete, I exported the Gerber files for the design and submitted them to PCBWay for manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a future post, I will populate the board and test it.&lt;/p&gt;
